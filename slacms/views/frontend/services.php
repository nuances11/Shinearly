                        <p>First, all you need is a free Skype and/or Zoom account.
                            We call you via one of these accounts at a pre-arranged, convenient time of yours to conduct an English Speaking Proficiency Assessment.
                            You will be able to know your student level at the end of it.
                            Student levels are categorized into eight from Beginner to Proficient.
                            Finally, you can now enroll and enjoy learning English at an arranged class time!</p>

                            You can also send your teacher an e-mail if you have further questions and requests.</p>
